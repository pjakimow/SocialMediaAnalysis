# Analysis of users emotions in texts

### Tasks

1. Arrange labels in the following way: [joy, fear, anger, sadness, disgust, shame, guilt].  

2. Build a representation of words using pre-trained word vectors, e.g. Word2Vec, GloVe. 

3. Build a sentence representation: Average word-vectors in a sentence or use flattened sequence representation (requires padding as sentences have a varying length).

4. Build an MLP network using any deep learning framework, eg. Keras, Tensorflow, PyTorch to classify sentences.

5. Validate the trained model using data acquired from social media, e.g. Twitter and analyse obtained predictions.
